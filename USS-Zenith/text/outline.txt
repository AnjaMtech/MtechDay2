First thing about D&D, you can do anything you want to. If you want to put a wig on a ferocious tiger, feel free

Welcome onto the USS Zenith, I am Captain Josiah Malone.

The captain introduces the players to the ship.
After talking to the captain other crewmembers give you weird stares.
You are shown to your shared quarters
Captain gives you mission to capture runaway
Send you onto planet Minolia
Beam down in the middle of a cityscape
Each player starts out with a
  -phaser
  -communicator
  -picture of Renee
  -Tricorder
  -200 of the local currency
One player has a medical tricorder and supplies
It is 9am on Minolia

You beam onto Minolia in an empty alleyway. As you step into the bustling city you notice it looks a lot like 21st century Earth. Advertisements fill most empty spaces, various restaurant and company logos dotting the landscape.

You see a small protest happening with people holding signs depicting pure white humanoid faces in cages with pointed ears and fangs. Each has various captions such as "Alien belong in space, not in congress", and "Minoan people for Minoan problems. Vote for Korano."



Players can either bring Renee into custody, fail to do so, or choosingly allow her to go.
